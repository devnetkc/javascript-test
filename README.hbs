## Project Overview

### Given Variables:
* [~Employees](#module_cloud360..Employees)
* [~Revenue2013](#module_cloud360..Revenue2013)
* [~CommissionRules](#module_cloud360..CommissionRules)

### Details
Below are individual problems, write a function/functions to accomplish the use-cases below.
Write all problems to an HTML page (or pages, if preferred) and present in a User-Interface that displays this raw data in an easily readable format.
Comment code from a developer's-perspective (i.e. you are working on a team that will need to review/alter this code) and also provide comments as to why you chose to write a particular solution in the way you did.


Write solutions as efficiently as possible


Explain what tools were used during this practice - what program did you use to write this, what tool(s) did you use to debug, what references did you use if any were necessary?

### Questions

1. Assume that today is **1/1/2014**, update each employee's record to indicate the number of days until their birthday. Store the resulting value in a new key on the employee object.

2. Update each Employee object to contain a reference to their "best" customer (as defined by who purchased the most in the 2013 year).  Store the resulting value in a new key on the employee object.

3. The 2013 Revenue element on the Employee records needs to be updated with the *"revenue2013"* list of data. Chelsea Chastain manages a team of employees - her 2013 Revenue number should be derived from the total revenue of all of the employees she manages.  Store the resulting value in a new key on the employee object.

4. Calculate the Employee's commission based on the 2013 Revenue: the employee receives a percentage of the revenue they generated for the year as well as a bonus. The bonus is a flat-sum of money if they managed to generate more revenue than the previous year.

5. Write two questions that are similar to problems 1-4 and execute on them. This should demonstrate an understanding of similar business processes. (Feel free to use the three variables provided, or construct your own)
